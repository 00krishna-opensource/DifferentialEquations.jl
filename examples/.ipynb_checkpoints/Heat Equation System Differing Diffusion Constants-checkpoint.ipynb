    "# Heat Equation System: Differing Diffusion Constants\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem we will define a system of Heat equations where the two variables do not interact, but have different diffusion constants (for an example which shows interactions between variables, see the Gierer-Meinhardt example). We will solve the Heat Equation with no forcing term ($f\\equiv0$) with $\\delta(x-.5)$ as the starting distribution where $\\delta$ is the Dirac-$\\delta$ distribution. One example where this equation shows up is in modeling the dispersion of a protein throughout a biological organism. If you let the concentration of the protein be the variable, then it diffuses a la the Heat Equation with no forcing, and if all of the protein started at one spot, that would be represented by the Dirac-$\\delta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define the problem, we use the following syntax. Note that this example is provided by DifferentialEquations.jl in the file `/premades/premade_problems.jl` and thus the following cell does not need to be run:"

We then solve the equation on a square mesh with Neumann boundary conditions. These Neumann boundary conditions, also known as reflective boundary conditions, could represent a barrier that the proteins cannot cross. Thus the solution can be animated as follows: (note: this may take a awhile to run)"
