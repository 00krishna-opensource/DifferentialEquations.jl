    "# Solving Equations with Julia-Defined Types\n",

    "One of the nice things about DifferentialEquations.jl is that it is designed with Julia's type system in mind. What this means is, if you have properly defined a Number type, you can use this number type in DifferentialEquations.jl's algorithms! [Note that this is restricted to the native algorithms of DifferentialEquations.jl. The external solvers are not compatible with some number systems. For example, ODE.jl will throw errors unless certain options are set, and ODEInterface will convert the numbers to floats].\n",
    "\n",
    "DifferentialEquations.jl determines the numbers to use in its solvers via the types that are designated by Δt and the initial condition of the problem. It will keep the time values in the same type as Δt, and the solution values in the same type as the initial condition. [Note that adaptive timestepping requires that Δt be compaible with `sqrt` and `^` functions. Thus Δt cannot be Integer or numbers like that if adaptive timestepping is chosen].\n",

    "As you can see, DifferentialEquations.jl can use arbitrary Julia-defined number systems in its arithmetic. The only limitations are the limitations inherent in the number systems themselves. ArbFloats and ArbReals are the most feature-complete and give great performance compared to BigFloats, and thus I recommend their use when high-precision (less than ~512-800 bits) is required. DecFP is a great library for high-performance decimal numbers and works well as well. Other number systems could use some modernization."
