# DifferentialEquations.jl Documentation

This is a package for solving numerically solving differential equations in Julia by Chris Rackauckas. The purpose of this package is to supply efficient Julia implementations of solvers for various differential equations. Equations within the realm of this package include ordinary differential equations (ODEs), stochastic ordinary differential equations (SODEs or SDEs), stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), partial differential equations (with both finite difference and finite element methods), differential algebraic equations, and differential delay equations. It includes algorithms from very recent research, as well as algorithms optimized for HPC applications. It integrates with the Julia package sphere, for example using Juno's progress meter, and wraps other differential equation solvers so that many different methods for solving the equations can be accessed by simply switching a keyword argument.

All of the algorithms are thoroughly tested to ensure accuracy. Convergence tests are included in the [test/](https://github.com/ChrisRackauckas/DifferentialEquations.jl/tree/master/test) folder. The algorithms were also tested to show correctness with nontrivial behavior such as Turing morphogenesis. Example IJulia notebooks
[can be found in the examples folder](https://github.com/ChrisRackauckas/DifferentialEquations.jl/tree/master/examples). If you find any example where there seems
to be an error, please open an issue.

If you have any questions, or just want to chat about solvers/using the package, please feel free to message me in the [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/ChrisRackauckas/DifferentialEquations.jl?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge).

## Supported Equations

For PDEs, one can optionally specify a noise equation. The solvers currently have
stochastic variants for handling Gaussian Space-time white noise SPDEs.

## Implemented Solvers

For PDEs, [method] denotes an additional version for handling stochastic partial
differential equations. SDE solvers and ODE solvers take in general sized inputs.
For example, if uâ‚€ is a matrix (and your problem functions are designed to work
with matrices), then the solver will use the matrices without error.

## IJulia Notebook Tutorials

If you have [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) installed, you can access
extra tutorials in the supplied IJulia notebooks via:

```julia
using IJulia
cd(Pkg.dir("DifferentialEquations")*"/examples")
notebook()
```

Otherwise, these notebooks can be viewed [via the Github repository](https://github.com/ChrisRackauckas/DifferentialEquations.jl/tree/master/examples)
(note that Github renders them slightly incorrectly, so it will look better in IJulia!).
